<h2>Knowledge of the different machine learning algorithms </h2>

<p>During the Machine Learning module, I had a chance to acquire a considerable amount of knowledge in the field of Artificial Intelligence algorithms and data-based reasoning. The first unit of the module introduced students to the general impact of machine learning in contemporary industry, modern societies as well as the economy in general. The subsequent initial units focused on the importance of understanding and appropriate preparation of the data including especially Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). EDA is a set of tools helping the researcher provide a general outline of the data despite its size; one of the most common approaches is the so-called five numbers summary: minimum, maximum, mean, quantiles, and standard deviation. There is no handy way of assessing the big data other than using the EDA, and a meticulous approach to data understanding at the beginning may spare a significant amount of time later in designing the model.
</p>
<p>Having familiarized ourselves with the general data preparatory tools, we dove into various algorithms of machine learning in the next units. We started with absolute basics: often underestimated correlation and regression. While the former measures the correlation between two variables, the latter estimates the linear relationship between them (produces an optimal linear equation). These two tools, despite their apparent simplicity, are sufficient for many tasks that are linear or can be linearized.
</p>
<p>The next unit focused on the flag-ship unsupervised learning algorithm: clustering (Kubat, 2015). This algorithm aims to divide the set of observables into subgroups (clusters) consisting of elements sharing similar qualities. I must admit, that the clustering algorithm is one of my favorite ones, mainly because of the aforementioned automatic functioning. Because of this on one hand, and gaining proficiency in Python on the other,  I decided to implement my clustering algorithm from scratch. After some time, I succeeded in this matter, and the result can be seen in my e-portfolio.
</p>
<p>As a next step in our endeavors, we moved to the crème de la crème of Artificial Intelligence to many: artificial neural networks (ANN). As an engineer by teaching, I especially value the mathematically proven fact that this kind of algorithm scaled and equipped with adjusted weights is able to reconstruct any real domain function. In units 7 and 8 we were introduced to basic ANN artifacts such as artificial neurons, activation function (e.g. sigmoid), weights, bias, forward- and backpropagation, and perceptron (Kubat, 2015). In turn, unit 8 concentrated on training and backpropagation – the latter notion, with no doubts, acts as a capstone for ANN's successes in recent years. To say the least, just as the module kept going, backpropagation popularizer  – Geoffrey Hinton – has been awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics. Thanks to this module I was able to structure my prior knowledge and learn about other interesting subdomains. Back in the day, I also attempted to write an entire ANN from scratch in Java – and succeeded, but any real-life operation on such a complicated piece of code made its further usage impossible. (The code for this you can also find in my GitHub, outside of the University of Essex branch). 
</p>
<p>In the next unit, we took a closer look at a very special member of the ANN family: convolutional neural network (CNN). CNN takes advantage of multi-layer perceptron adding a few layers of preliminary processing: features detection based on “walking” analyzing window (kernel) and downscaling (Bhatt, 2024). This technique’s great quality is that backpropagation works both with MLP and kernel layers.
</p>
<p>Approaching the final modules, we were taught about model selection and evaluation. My opinion is that nowadays, with the dynamic development of code frameworks and rising computational power, what soon might be of the highest importance for researchers is the ability to properly choose between model A and model B. The metrics presented in the module gave us a profound understanding of this complex process, just to name a few: ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic), AUC (Area Under the Curve), sensitivity, and specificity. 
</p>
<h2>Team work: my contributions and experiences as a member </h2>

<p>During unit 4 we were also tasked with a group project, which I was privileged to run with talented fellow students: Natali, Paulina, Panagiotis, and Nima. The project deliverable was the analysis of the AirB'n'B New York City dataset. My role in the group was to propose our initial approach to the machine learning model and to perform needed preliminary calculations to check the plausibility of the taken path.  
</p>
<p>After careful consideration, we decided to reconstruct from the very limited, aggregated data from 2023 - the number of active and inactive properties from each subsequent year from the 2011-2019 timeframe. The task was outstandingly difficult, and am very proud of the team for taking on such an uneasy assignment, and also that a humble contribution of mine helped the team to confirm the feasibility of this mission. Details about my contribution with a longer explanation will be found in my GitHub portfolio.
</p>
<p>Apart from project deliverables, the teamwork itself makes an interesting case to further elaborate. Initially, despite an authentically friendly atmosphere, each team member presented a slightly different approach, and oftentimes we fell into exaggerated voting on every aspect. However, it only took some time for us to adjust and effectively run our work. Nevertheless, I can safely say that the value of each team member's contribution is hardly to be overestimated. A great idea was to divide us into two subgroups: data analytical and narrative. This step helped us to efficiently move forward.
</p>
<h2>The impact on my professional and personal development</h2>

<p>Finalizing this module contributed a lot to my personal development, which, I believe will reflect on uplifting my professional path, too. The reason I decided to choose the Artificial Intelligence course at the University of Essex was primarily to deepen my expertise in either theoretical or practical aspects of AI, and the Machine Learning module perfectly accounts for both of them. Diving deep into the realm of various cutting-edge mathematical algorithms is one of the most beneficial activities, that one can do for his/her mind.
