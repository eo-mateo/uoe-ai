							<p><i>Collaborative discussions was an on-line space for the students of AI programme at University of Essex to debate and discuss the vital technological topics. It consisted of the initial post outdrawing the author's perspective, subsequent peer responses and, finally, a conclusion of each voice in the summary post written by the author.  </i>
                <h2>My initial post:</h2>
                <figure class="quote">
              <p>From the beginning of the organised production era—however we define it—the constituting elements—machines, human operators, third parties—ran with very little interconnectivity with other components.</p>

<p>In the last few years, the development of automation, robotization, and information technologies has transformed the production plants into large networks of cross-conscious elements able to complexly predict and adapt; the leap ahead was of such importance, it deserved another era in industrial annals and marked the advent of Industry 4.0 (Schwab, 2016).</p>

<p>However, nihil novi sub sole, with great opportunities come also new threads. Unprecedented unmanned processes rely on software, hardware, and communication resilience. Consisting of hundreds or thousands of vulnerable endpoints, while under attack it is enough to break even one of them to compromise the entire system. In consequence, the factory's ecosystem functioning beneficially as one digital organism until this day, suddenly encounters a catastrophic breakdown and stops functioning completely.</p>

<p>As an example of that, let me recall the once-famous Schreiber Foods case. The company, a big diary producer in the USA, in 2021 was victimized by a ransomware attack on its computer networks. Subsequently, the entire facility went immediately down causing great harm to the supply chain in the food industry. In the end, the implications for the customers just weeks before Christmas were considerably uncomfortable (Shepel, 2021). The financial impact on the company has remained undisclosed, yet for the entity of $3 bln annual revenue holding 75% market share in yellow cheese production, each day of blackout results in dozens of millions lost.</p>

<p>From all the information systems failures, the malicious attacks occupy newspapers headliners the most frequent. Nonetheless, whatever the cause is, the Industry 4.0 engineers must tackle the vulnerabilities as soon as possible.</p>

								<h2>Responses from my colleagues</h2>
<figure>
<p><i>by Rodrigo Pereira Cruz - Sunday, 27 October 2024, 12:44 PM</i></p>
<p>My peer did an outstanding job in addressing both the positive and negative aspects of Industry 4.0. Focusing on the food industry, Mateusz explained how Schreiber Foods, a major dairy producer in the United States, was crippled by a ransomware attack that not only resulted in a daily loss of dozens of millions of dollars, but also affected public perception of the company as it was paralysed by the attack just weeks before Christmas.</p>

<p>Ransomware (ransom software) is a subset of malware designed to restrict access to a system or data until a requested ransom amount from the attacker is satisfied (Savage et al., 2015). The inherent difficulty of recovering a system after being affected by ransomware, and the increasing prevalence of this type of attack, has made it one of the most notorious threats since 2005 (Kharraz et al., 2015).</p>

<p>With the advent of Industry 4.0 and threats such as ransomware becoming more prevalent, cybersecurity has become a critical concern for all industries. For the food industry, a sector increasingly reliant on digitalisation yet lacking in cyber defense measures compared to other industries (Alqudhaibi et al., 2024), the need to invest significantly more resources in cybersecurity has become readily apparent, to prevent similar incidents, like the Schreiber Foods attack, from occurring across the industry.</p>

<p>Overall, the rise of Industry 4.0 has escalated ransomware and other cyber threats, especially for industries like food production with historically weaker cybersecurity measures, necessitating the adoption of more secure technologies and the establishment of clear processes for managing such threats.</p>
