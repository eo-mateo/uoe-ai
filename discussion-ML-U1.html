                <h2>My initial post:</h2>
                <figure class="quote">
              <p>From the beginning of the organised production era—however we define it—the constituting elements—machines, human operators, third parties—ran with very little interconnectivity with other components.</p>

<p>In the last few years, the development of automation, robotization, and information technologies has transformed the production plants into large networks of cross-conscious elements able to complexly predict and adapt; the leap ahead was of such importance, it deserved another era in industrial annals and marked the advent of Industry 4.0 (Schwab, 2016).</p>

<p>However, nihil novi sub sole, with great opportunities come also new threads. Unprecedented unmanned processes rely on software, hardware, and communication resilience. Consisting of hundreds or thousands of vulnerable endpoints, while under attack it is enough to break even one of them to compromise the entire system. In consequence, the factory's ecosystem functioning beneficially as one digital organism until this day, suddenly encounters a catastrophic breakdown and stops functioning completely.</p>

<p>As an example of that, let me recall the once-famous Schreiber Foods case. The company, a big diary producer in the USA, in 2021 was victimized by a ransomware attack on its computer networks. Subsequently, the entire facility went immediately down causing great harm to the supply chain in the food industry. In the end, the implications for the customers just weeks before Christmas were considerably uncomfortable (Shepel, 2021). The financial impact on the company has remained undisclosed, yet for the entity of $3 bln annual revenue holding 75% market share in yellow cheese production, each day of blackout results in dozens of millions lost.</p>

<p>From all the information systems failures, the malicious attacks occupy newspapers headliners the most frequent. Nonetheless, whatever the cause is, the Industry 4.0 engineers must tackle the vulnerabilities as soon as possible.</p>

								<h2>Responses from my colleagues</h2>
<figure class="quote">
<p><i>by Rodrigo Pereira Cruz - Sunday, 27 October 2024, 12:44 PM</i></p>
<p>My peer did an outstanding job in addressing both the positive and negative aspects of Industry 4.0. Focusing on the food industry, Mateusz explained how Schreiber Foods, a major dairy producer in the United States, was crippled by a ransomware attack that not only resulted in a daily loss of dozens of millions of dollars, but also affected public perception of the company as it was paralysed by the attack just weeks before Christmas.</p>

<p>Ransomware (ransom software) is a subset of malware designed to restrict access to a system or data until a requested ransom amount from the attacker is satisfied (Savage et al., 2015). The inherent difficulty of recovering a system after being affected by ransomware, and the increasing prevalence of this type of attack, has made it one of the most notorious threats since 2005 (Kharraz et al., 2015).</p>

<p>With the advent of Industry 4.0 and threats such as ransomware becoming more prevalent, cybersecurity has become a critical concern for all industries. For the food industry, a sector increasingly reliant on digitalisation yet lacking in cyber defense measures compared to other industries (Alqudhaibi et al., 2024), the need to invest significantly more resources in cybersecurity has become readily apparent, to prevent similar incidents, like the Schreiber Foods attack, from occurring across the industry.</p>

<p>Overall, the rise of Industry 4.0 has escalated ransomware and other cyber threats, especially for industries like food production with historically weaker cybersecurity measures, necessitating the adoption of more secure technologies and the establishment of clear processes for managing such threats.</p>

<p>Dear Mateusz, your post captures the complexities of cybersecurity in Industry 4.0 and the risks posed by interconnected systems. The Schreiber Foods incident you mentioned highlights how a single cyber breach can disrupt entire supply chains, illustrating the vulnerabilities within automated networks. Globally, ransomware attacks have surged by 93% from 2020 to 2021, costing businesses over $20 billion in damages (Goswami, 2024). In the manufacturing sector, downtime caused by such attacks can cost an average of $260,000 per hour, making proactive cybersecurity crucial.</p>

<p>One solution to mitigate these risks is AI-based anomaly detection. Goswami (2024) emphasises that real-time monitoring powered by AI can detect unusual network activities, allowing companies to respond swiftly before threats escalate. With industry leaders increasingly investing in AI, sectors relying on continuous operation can minimise disruptions and avoid catastrophic losses (Bécue et al., 2021). One notable example is Siemens’ AI-driven cybersecurity framework, which has been instrumental in protecting critical infrastructure from malware and ransomware attacks by detecting irregular patterns in data flow across networks.</p>

<p>Furthermore, Bécue et al. (2021) discuss how machine learning algorithms improve defense mechanisms by learning from previous threats, enabling adaptive responses. This adaptability is critical in a landscape where attacks evolve continuously. Another effective approach is network segmentation, which isolates critical systems from general operations, limiting the spread of a breach if one segment is compromised.</p>

<p>These proactive approaches demonstrate how integrating advanced AI systems with strategic network configurations could protect against potential threats. Given these solutions, what additional cybersecurity practices should companies implement to enhance their resilience as threats continue to grow?</p>

<p>Mateusz, I found your post on the Schreiber Foods ransomware attack fascinating, especially your emphasis on the vulnerability of interconnected systems in Industry 4.0. As you pointed out, the interconnectivity that powers so many industrial processes also can leave companies exposed to system-wide disruptions if just one endpoint is compromised (Shepel, 2021).</p>

<p>One way in which companies can protect themselves is by employing Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA), which assumes that every connection, both inside and outside the network, is a potential threat (Rose et al., 2020). By implementing ZTA, industries like food manufacturing can minimise the risk of lateral movement within their systems, limiting the potential damage caused by ransomware.</p>

<p>Additionally, introducing AI-based threat detection systems can help identify unusual patterns of behaviour, enabling real-time responses to cyber-attacks (Bécue et al., 2021). While ransomware remains a constant threat, combining these proactive security measures with network segmentation could mitigate the impact of such attacks in the future. What are your thoughts on integrating AI-driven solutions with existing security protocols in industries like food production?</p>

<h2>My summary post:</h2>
						<figure class="quote">
<p><i>by Mateusz Niewczas - Friday, 8 November 2024, 8:40 PM</i></p>
<p>The advent of Industry 4.0 has started a brand new era in manufacturing and production (Schwab, 2016). Moreover, historically, each industrial revolution marked a significant fingerprint on the entire economy; and, what needs to be added, sometimes a brutal carving was it rather than a soft touch. Nevertheless, overall the profits and losses account is overwhelmingly considered positive.</p>

<p>When it comes to Industry 4.0 advantages, the immense number of those could nearly be dubbed NaN, speaking data-scientifically. However, the discussion on the threads—the topic we interestingly debated--captures little attention publicly.</p>

<p>In the first post, I introduced the Schreiber Foods incident as an illustration of Industry 4.0 exposure and vulnerability. To evoke basic facts about the case: in 2021 the company, the biggest dairy producer in the USA, became a victim of a ransomware (ransom software) attack. The consequences were devastating: a few blackout days in the highest demand season (weeks before Christmas) and undoubtedly multimillion losses (undisclosed, however). This incident was caused by a single computer compromise, which subsequently immediately spread out across the company’s interconnected network.</p>

<p>I am very grateful for the contribution my colleagues made to the topic. They brilliantly extended my initial perspective of some new aspects. Rodrigo in the first place, elaborated in detail on the ransomware attacks, aptly emphasizing the inevitable escalation of those in the near future caused by the ubiquity of Industry 4.0. In turn, Nasser suggests that mitigation of these risks lies in employing AI detection. Along with Goswami (2024), he argues this kind of highly aware and immediately reacting tool can effectively stand up against the nowadays’ cyberthreads. Reece, another colleague with a great contribution to the discussion, agrees to double down on AI-based systems detecting unusual patterns in vast amounts of near real-time data and counteracting them (intrusion detection systems, IDS; Bécue et al., 2021).</p>

<p>Concluding our discussion: while we unanimously agreed on the significance of Industry 4.0, all of the debaters were obviously aware of many threads that come along with it. What is interesting, we believe that the key to neutralizing most of them will be utilizing a constituting part of Industry 4.0 itself – Artificial Intelligence.</p>
