							<h1>Unit 7. Perceptron Activities</h1>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic13.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>As a formative activity in Unit 7, three different Google Colab notebooks were shared: each with different excercise to follow.</p>
							<p></p>
							<h2>Excercise 1. Simple perceptron</h2>

							<p><a href="perceptron1.ipynb">See the excercise 1. code with commentary and outcomes.</a></p>
							<p>Perceptron is a single processing unit acting like single biological neuron. In the beginning, two inputs and two weights were declared. As a first step to create a perceptron,
                weight - input pair must be multiplied and added to another pair. This was called "a sum" in the excercise. <p></p>Secondly, a "step" function was implemented with the use of simple
              "if" block. Combination of two gives a perceptron outcome. In the first example, two cases were presented: positive and negative weights.
              </p>

							<p>Excercise 2. encompasses larger scope than predecessor. Starting with establishing inputs and weights as well as defining a step function.
								However, it reaches one step further than other with including training process. We are given with nearly fully implemented backpropagation
								except derivatives handling, but with learning slope and weight update. Thanks to this mechanism, the perceptron was able to learn AND function.
